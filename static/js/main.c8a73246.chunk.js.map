We reserve the right to take exclusive control and defense of any claim, and you will cooperate fully with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>\n<h3>Disputes, Including Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h3>\n<p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Site or Apps, or to products or services sold or distributed by us or through us, will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court, with the following exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may assert claims in small claims court if your claims apply;</li>\n<li>If a claim involves the conditional license granted to you as described in the Ownership of Content and Grant of Conditional License section above, either of us may file a lawsuit in a federal or state court located within New York County, New York, and we both consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes; and</li>\n<li>In the event that the arbitration agreement in these Terms is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against us (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in a federal or state court located within New York County, New York, and we both consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</li>\n<li>The arbitration agreement in these Terms is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. It is intended to be broadly interpreted, and will survive termination of these Terms. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.</li>\n<li>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</li>\n<li>We each agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. You agree to waive any right to a jury trial or to participate in a class action. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration section will be null and void and neither of us will be entitled to arbitrate our dispute.</li>\n<li>You agree that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce and will be governed by and construed in accordance with federal law to the fullest extent possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>No Reliance and Forward-Looking Statements</h3>\n<p>The information contained on the Site or Apps may not be current and should not be used or relied on for any investment decision regarding our securities or for any similar purpose. If necessary, we will file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Copies of our filings are available at the Investor Relations section of this Site or Apps and also at the SEC’s website or Apps at www.sec.gov.</p>\n<p>Statements on the Site or Apps regarding our financial condition, results of operations and business and our expectations or beliefs concerning future events that are not historical facts are “Forward-Looking Statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Use of the words “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “estimates” or words of similar meaning is intended to identify Forward-Looking Statements but is not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. We caution you that there are some known and unknown factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such ForwardLooking Statements, including but not limited to economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors affecting our operations, markets, products, services and prices, as well as the risks and uncertainties set forth in the documents we file with the SEC, specifically the section titled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any Forward-Looking Statements because of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n<p>If you have any questions, comments or complaints regarding these Terms or the Site or Apps, please contact us at:</p>\n<p>Broker Genius, Inc.<br/>\n<a href=\"https://support@brokergenius.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">support@brokergenius.com</a></p>\n\t\t    </div>\n\n            <FormControlLabel\n        control={\n          <Checkbox checked={accepted} onChange={handleChange} value=\"checkedA\" />\n        }\n        label=\"I agree to the terms & conditions and the privacy policy\"\n      />\n\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport TextField from '@material-ui/core/TextField';\n\n\nexport default function() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n              <TextField id=\"standard-basic\" label=\"Password\" /><br/>\n              <TextField id=\"standard-basic\" label=\"Confirm Password\" /><br/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport TextField from '@material-ui/core/TextField';\nimport InputLabel from '@material-ui/core/InputLabel';\nimport MenuItem from '@material-ui/core/MenuItem';\nimport FormControl from '@material-ui/core/FormControl';\nimport Select from '@material-ui/core/Select';\n\n\nexport default function() {\n\n    const [pos, setPos] = React.useState('');\n\n    const handleChange = event => {\n        setPos(event.target.value);\n      };\n\n    return (\n        <div>\n              <TextField id=\"standard-basic\" label=\"Company Name\" /><br/>\n              <FormControl style={{minWidth: 120}}>\n        <InputLabel id=\"demo-simple-select-label\">Point of Sale</InputLabel>\n        <Select\n          labelId=\"demo-simple-select-label\"\n          id=\"demo-simple-select\"\n          value={pos}\n          onChange={handleChange}\n        >\n          <MenuItem value={'ei'}>EI Box Office</MenuItem>\n          <MenuItem value={'pn'}>POSNExt</MenuItem>\n          <MenuItem value={'vs'}>Skybox</MenuItem>\n          <MenuItem value={'tu'}>Ticket Utils</MenuItem>\n          <MenuItem value={'tn'}>Ticket Network</MenuItem>\n          <MenuItem value={'consignment'}>Consignment</MenuItem>\n          <MenuItem value={'none'}>None</MenuItem>\n          <MenuItem value={'other'}>Other</MenuItem>\n\n        </Select>\n      </FormControl>\n\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport TextField from '@material-ui/core/TextField';\n\n\nexport default function() {\n    return (\n        <div>\n              <TextField id=\"standard-basic\" label=\"Stubhub Username\" /><br/>\n              <TextField id=\"standard-basic\" label=\"Stubhub Password\" /><br/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}","import React from 'react';\nimport { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\nimport Stepper from '@material-ui/core/Stepper';\nimport Step from '@material-ui/core/Step';\nimport StepLabel from '@material-ui/core/StepLabel';\nimport Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';\nimport Typography from '@material-ui/core/Typography';\nimport Step1 from './Step1';\nimport Step2 from './Step2';\nimport Step3 from './Step3';\nimport Step4 from './Step4';\nimport Step5 from './Step5';\n\nconst useStyles = makeStyles(theme => ({\n  root: {\n    width: '100%',\n  },\n  backButton: {\n    marginRight: theme.spacing(1),\n  },\n  instructions: {\n    marginTop: theme.spacing(1),\n    marginBottom: theme.spacing(1),\n  },\n}));\n\nfunction getSteps() {\n  return ['Basic Info', 'Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy', 'Select a Password', 'Account Details', 'StubHub Details'];\n}\n\nfunction getStepContent(stepIndex) {\n  switch (stepIndex) {\n    case 0:\n      return (<Step1/>);\n    case 1:\n      return (<Step2/>);\n    case 2:\n      return (<Step3/>);\n    case 3:\n      return (<Step4/>);\n    case 4:\n      return (<Step5/>);\n    default:\n      return 'Unknown stepIndex';\n  }\n}\n\nexport default function HorizontalLabelPositionBelowStepper() {\n  const classes = useStyles();\n  const [activeStep, setActiveStep] = React.useState(0);\n  const steps = getSteps();\n\n  const handleNext = () => {\n    setActiveStep(prevActiveStep => prevActiveStep + 1);\n  };\n\n  const handleBack = () => {\n    setActiveStep(prevActiveStep => prevActiveStep - 1);\n  };\n\n  const handleReset = () => {\n    setActiveStep(0);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div className={classes.root}>\n      <Stepper activeStep={activeStep} alternativeLabel>\n        {steps.map(label => (\n          <Step key={label}>\n            <StepLabel>{label}</StepLabel>\n          </Step>\n        ))}\n      </Stepper>\n      <div>\n        {activeStep === steps.length ?
